# Claude Code PR Review Plugin

An Azure DevOps pull request review plugin for Claude Code that fetches PR comments and guides you through addressing them interactively.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- Azure DevOps account with access to your organization
- Personal Access Token (PAT) with Code (Read) scope

### Installation

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pr-review-plugin.git
cd pr-review-plugin
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

The installer will:
1. Prompt you for your Azure DevOps configuration (organization, project, repository)
2. Auto-detect your Python installation
3. Ask for your Azure DevOps Personal Access Token
4. Create the configuration file at `~/.claude/ado-config.json`
5. Install the `/pr-review` command to Claude Code

### Creating Your Azure DevOps Personal Access Token

1. Go to https://dev.azure.com/{your-org}/_usersSettings/tokens
2. Click "New Token"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Claude Code PR Review")
4. Set expiration (recommend 90 days or custom)
5. Under "Scopes", select "Code" ‚Üí "Read"
6. Click "Create"
7. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again!)

### Usage

```bash
# In Claude Code, review a PR by number
/pr-review 87663
```

Claude will:
1. Fetch all comments from the PR
2. Create a task list of active comments
3. Guide you through addressing each one interactively
4. Offer to commit the changes when done

## üìñ What It Does

This plugin integrates with Azure DevOps to:

- **Fetch PR Comments**: Retrieves all review comments from your PR
- **Filter Active Comments**: Shows only comments that need to be addressed
- **Interactive Workflow**: Guides you through each comment one by one
- **Code Context**: Shows the relevant code and explains what needs to change
- **Educational**: Explains WHY changes are needed, not just WHAT
- **Track Progress**: Uses TodoWrite to track which comments you've addressed
- **Git Integration**: Offers to create a commit with all your fixes

## üîß Configuration

The plugin uses `~/.claude/ado-config.json`:

```json
{
  "organization": "cudirect",
  "project": "Origence",
  "repository": "arcOS.Web",
  "scriptPath": "C:\\path\\to\\pr-review-plugin\\scripts\\fetch_pr_comments.py",
  "pythonPath": "C:\\path\\to\\python.exe",
  "token": "your-azure-devops-pat",
  "debugMode": false
}
```

You can manually edit this file if you need to update your token or switch repositories.

## üîß For Your Coworkers

To share this plugin with your team:

1. **Share the repo**: Push your pr-review-plugin to a shared location or Git repo
2. **Installation**: Have them clone and run `.\scripts\install.ps1`
3. **Configuration**: They'll be prompted for:
   - Your organization name (e.g., "cudirect")
   - Project name (e.g., "Origence")
   - Repository name (e.g., "arcOS.Web")
   - Their own Azure DevOps PAT token

Each person needs their own PAT token, but everything else can be the same.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"Error: No token provided"**
- Check that `~/.claude/ado-config.json` has a valid `token` field
- Ensure your PAT hasn't expired

**"Authentication failed"**
- Verify your PAT has Code (Read) scope
- Create a new token if needed

**"Python not found"**
- Install Python 3.8+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Update `pythonPath` in the config file

**"Script not found"**
- Ensure `scriptPath` in config points to `fetch_pr_comments.py`
- Use absolute paths, not relative
