## üí° Pro Tips

### Keep Your Token Updated
PAT tokens expire! When yours expires, just edit `~/.claude/ado-config.json` and update the `token` field.

### Multiple Repos
Working on multiple repos? You can manually edit the config to switch between them, or keep multiple config files and swap them.

### Share With Your Team
Your teammates can use the same org/project/repo settings, but everyone needs their own PAT token.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"Error: Config file not found"**
- Run `.\scripts\install.ps1` again

**"Authentication failed"**
- Check your PAT in `~/.claude/ado-config.json`
- Verify it has Code (Read) scope
- Check if it's expired

**"Python not found"**
- Install Python 3.8+ from python.org
- Update `pythonPath` in the config

**"No active comments"**
- Great! Your PR has been fully reviewed
- Or the reviewer hasn't left comments yet

## üìÅ Files Created

- `~/.claude/ado-config.json` - Configuration (includes PAT)
- `~/.claude/commands/pr-review.md` - The slash command

## ü§ù Sharing With Teammates

1. Push this plugin repo to a shared location
2. Have teammates run:
   ```powershell
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   cd pr-review-plugin
   .\scripts\install.ps1
   ```
3. They'll be prompted for the same info
4. Each person needs their own PAT token

## üéâ You're Ready!

You're now ready to address PR comments efficiently with Claude!
